1,Trey Benson,"I think Trey fits us from a schematic standpoint, in that hes instinctive, hes tough, hes physical, hes got good contact balance, hes able to run through and gain tough yards."
2,Trey Benson,"And then one thing that stands out about Trey is that when he does have a crease, he has the speed to break it and pop the long run  something that you dont often see in running backs that are his size. So, I think he complements James [Conner] very well."
3,MarShawn Lloyd,"No, I would like to get him out there as much as possible. Hes got a skill set thats a little bit different than AJs, as far as his speed… Itll be nice to get him the ball in space and just see what he can do, ‘cause I think hes gonna add a good explosive element to the offense, for sure."
4,Bucky Irving,"The nice thing I like about Bucky is he gets to his top speeds early. Like, when he accepts the handoff, he bursts and accelerates through the hole and can make people miss in space."
5,Bucky Irving,He has taken every detail that weve coached throughout this offseason and applied it.
6,Breece Hall,"Breece is the unquestioned bellcow, but even then, youre still talking 20, 25 touches."
7,Malachi Corley,"He is raw, from a route-running ability standpoint, so were obviously attacking that. Getting him the ball, and the creativity that comes with it, I think were all having a lot of fun looking at ways to get him the ball."
8,Drake Maye,"Ultimately, he still has to win that job and were not just gonna give it away. And I dont think Jacoby [Brissett]  the type of player, the type of competitor that he is  is just gonna give it up, either. So, well see what happens in camp."
9,Drake Maye,"I dont think many rookies are ready to just jump in and play. Look, at the end of the day, our philosophy is ‘the best players will play."
10,Derrick Henry,I think what its gonna look like is what its looked like in Tennessee  him running for a lot of yards.
11,Ben Sinnott,"He can do a lot of different things… He has that versatility as a blocker. And then as a receiver, he can do everything you want, too. I think the skys the limit for him."
12,Nick Chubb,"With Nick [Chubb], obviously, well continue to let him rehab, and when hes ready and the doctors tell me hes ready, he goes. Until then, we like the guys we have."
13,Christian Watson,"Christian Watson is in a great place now with his hamstring. He told him If theres ever a day you feel fatigued from multiple days in a row, let me know."
14,Devontez Walker,[Smith] made big plays when they counted. You could count on him. Hes a glue guy and I just think Tez has a lot of the same qualities.
15,Joe Burrow,Joe Burrow says theres still good days and bad days with the wrist. But feels good enough to practice and keep mindset a day at a time.
16,Treylon Burks,"[Boyd signing] means you dont have to rely on Burks to produce, which takes the pressure off of him and allows him to just go make plays when he gets opportunities (yes as that 4th receiver)."
17,MarShawn Lloyd,"I like his speed. I like his speed a lot. He had some good runs in OTAs where you saw his burst, you saw his vision, so Im excited to see what he can do out of the backfield."
18,Xavier Worthy,"Xavier is quick, Xavier is quick. No surprise he broke the 40-yard record. Hes looking great out there."
19,Xavier Worthy,"I thought he did a nice job picking things up. We asked him to do a whole lot of stuff there. He was put in mostly the primary spots, so it was good for him to get in there and move around a little bit."
20,Jalen McMillan,Bucs WR coach Bryan McClendon says that he likes Jalen McMillans flexibility to play on the outside and in the slot. He feels fortunate that he fell to Tampa Bay in the third round.
21,Anthony Richardson,"This is progressing really well. Im told Richardson feels hes full go at this point. Hes been throwing for a while now. Hes gradually grown to where he can throw full time with minimal restrictions. The Colts could be deliberate. They could hold him out for OTAs, 11-man work, minicamp, but the feeling is he wants to get started."
22,Roman Wilson,"Hes a good player, hes competitive, he creates separation at breakpoints. Hes battle-tested on the interior portions of the field. He comes from a winning program. You cant say enough about the winning component, in terms of how it shapes their relationships with the game, and what theyre willing to do, and their mettle. And he checks a lot of those boxes."
23,Bucky Irving,"He can make the first guy miss more often than not, and thats a rare trait to have in this ball game… To make a guy miss, the first guy miss, and potentially have big play ability is something that we didnt have a lot of last year."
24,Brock Bowers,"I mean, just different. Youre talking about probably the most dynamic football player in college football at that tight end position in a long time. And its rare you get a guy like that, that can line up as a slot receiver, see him in the backfield, reverses, catch the ball."
25,Jonathon Brooks,Jonathon Brooks says hes been taking the rehab on his knee up a notch since arriving in Charlotte. Hes five months removed from ACL surgery and reiterates hes on pace with his recovery.
26,Caleb Williams,"Bears QB Caleb Williams is being touted for his leadership, with OL Kiran Amegadjie saying he works hard and is always the first one in, in the morning. Williams' bear-claw gesture is catching on, and he carries himself like a franchise quarterback."
27,Bo Nix,"Broncos QB Bo Nix has been exactly what we saw during scouting, said HC Sean Payton. Nix has been unbelievably accurate, especially on downfield throws, hitting nearly every single receiver in stride right on the money."
28,J.J. McCarthy,"Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy is working on progression-based passing and avoiding interceptions in camp, described by HC Kevin O'Connell as a total learning environment."
29,Michael Penix Jr.,"QB Michael Penix Jr.'s arm was the draw at Falcons rookie minicamp, where he arrived early, led the offensive rookies on a pre-practice walk-through, and met Kirk Cousins."
30,Jayden Daniels,"Washington's QB Jayden Daniels was grateful punter Tress Way gave up jersey No. 5. HC Dan Quinn praised Daniels for his love of football, and rookie TE Ben Sinnott noted Daniels has the 'it' factor."
31,Drake Maye,Patriots rookie QB Drake Maye took center stage at rookie camp for a light workout. HC Jerod Mayo stated Maye has a lot to work on but is committed to putting in the time. The Patriots like Maye's physical ability and commitment to learn.
32,Xavier Legette,"Panthers WR Xavier Legette's explosiveness has stood out at Carolina camp. Legette wants to focus on routes the media said he couldn't run and showed all his physical traits through practices, including lining up as a gunner on special teams."
33,Javon Baker,Patriots fourth-round WR Javon Baker distinguished himself as one of the best players of the morning and made a couple of nice plays with QB Drake Maye during New England's first open rookie camp session.
34,Adonai Mitchell,"Colts WR Adonai Mitchell impressed by taking a crosser to the house from roughly 70 yards out during Indy's minicamp. Asked if he could name the 10 wideouts chosen before him, Mitchell dismissed the question."
35,Malik Nabers,WR Malik Nabers impressed in drills during Giants minicamp. HC Brian Daboll was happy with the way Nabers handled the ROY bet with former LSU teammate Jayden Daniels.
36,Tyler Guyton,"Tyler Guyton, moving from RT at Oklahoma to LT in Dallas, spent the last two weeks working with an OL expert to ease the transition. The Cowboys have high hopes for him and fellow rookie Cooper Beebe, who was getting reps at center."
37,Isaac Guerendo,"The top pass catcher at 49ers rookie minicamp was fourth-round RB Isaac Guerendo, who has a background as a receiver."
38,T'Vondre Sweat,"Titans rookie DT T'Vondre Sweat was the biggest dude on the field but did not struggle to move or pop up from the ground and punish a blocking sled. Tennessee is excited by the 6-4, 366-pounder."
39,Terrion Arnold,"Lions CB Terrion Arnold knows what HC Dan Campbell likes to hear: If my mom were a receiver, I'd jam her in the dirt."
40,Javonte Williams,"RB Javonte Williams will not get guaranteed touches in Denver. HC Sean Payton said Jaleel McLaughlin, Blake Watson, and others will compete for playing time."
41,Johnny Newton,"Washington's second-round DT Johnny Newton, who had surgery on his right foot in January, wore a boot on his other foot while watching practice and will undergo another surgery for a Jones fracture."
42,Rome Odunze,Bears WR Rome Odunze left practice with hamstring tightness but still walked through several drills.
43,Jaleel McLaughlin,Broncos HC Sean Payton discussed Jaleel McLaughlin's competition for the 'joker' role with Blake Watson. McLaughlin struggled in pass protection but touched the ball on 61.2% of the snaps he played last season.
44,Jonathon Brooks,"HC Dave Canales says the intent of the Panthers' offense is to run the ball, which bodes well for Jonathan Brooks. Brooks, though unable to practice, made mental notes to stay ready and engaged through every session."
45,Jalen Coker,"Jalen Coker, the UDFA out of Holy Cross, had a standout practice. HC Dave Canales praised his size, instincts, and top-of-route ability to separate, noting his craftiness in zones and ability to break tackles."
46,Ja'Tavion Sanders,Ja'Tavion Sanders said he is trying to be the next Greg Olsen.
47,Jahmyr Gibbs,Lions GM Brad Holmes expects Jahmyr Gibbs to see more of a load alongside David Montgomery. Holmes and HC Dan Campbell love the 1-2 punch and believe Gibbs has much more to offer in the passing game.
